What is state?:
States are what users interact with on a App. They determines how an object is rendered and behave throughout the life cycle of an application

Element:

Syntax:
----state----
state = {
      myState: 'State is an object that stores the "state" of a component.'
    }
render() {
        return (
            <View>
                <Text>
                    {this.state.myState}
                </Text>
            </View>
      );
   }
